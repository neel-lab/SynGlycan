% Comment lines start with '%' symbols
% All encoding should be in ANSI (or Windows Notepad default)
% Each data line contains three space-separated fields:
% "Original A(mino)A(cid)" "position of AA (count from the beginning of protein seq.) where AA is modified (0 implies all possible positions, no restrictions)" "AA after modification"
% correct examples:
% C 0 C<i>  -- for Cys carboxymethylation using iodoacetamide
% X 10,17 X<s>  -- sulfation at position 10 and 17 regardless of amino acid present
% Y 10,17 Y<s>  -- sulfate Tyr (Y) at position 10 and 17, provided Tyr is present at these positions
% incorrect examples 
% Y 35,0 Y<s>  -- 35 is redundant since 0 aldeady exists and implies that all Tyr are modified
% YC 0 YC<i> -- 2 amino acids as input cannot be recognized
% Note: GlycoPAT 2.0 only supports "0" as modification position, support for specific modification position will be added in future release
